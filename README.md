This is a simple phone book appliation made while learning pyhton in 2019.

This application allows users to;
 - Enter a new entry to the phone book
 - List all existing entries
 - Search for a specific entry
 - Delete an existing entry
 - Add a personal note to an exisiting entry
 - Delete an existing personal note 
 
 Note that this is a command line program and does not use a database to store entrys
 therefore all entry are only stored in run time.
